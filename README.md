### Coding Challenges

For the challenge: 
- clean formatting
- nice readme, info about installation / running the app, maybe explaining design choices  
- no console.log() or unnecessary comments
- good naming of functions and variables
- readability

### Example Challenge

Create an API which calculates how much your investment had been today if you had invested an arbitrary amount of dollars in bitcoin at an arbitrary date in the past.

E.g. If I had invested $1000 in Bitcoin on 8/2/2017, it would be worth $1628 dollars today.

Build a user interface for your API.

 Doing the challenge is one thing, but weâ€™re really interested in
how
you do it. Based on their specialities, developers embellish in different ways e.g.

- Deploying the finished application
- Creating a beautiful UI/UX
- High levels of test coverage
- Demonstrating knowledge about our tech stack e.g. using a serverless architecture

But donâ€™t get carried away! You wonâ€™t progress to the next round unless youâ€™ve:

Completed the task, and
Have a high level of code quality
